# 0x0C-python-almostacircle

## Description
This project is a continuation of the previous project, 0x0A-python-inheritance. It focuses on implementing classes and inheritance in Python, specifically for creating rectangles and squares. 

## Features
- Create a class Rectangle that inherits from Base and initializes with width, height, x, y, id.
- Create a class Square that inherits from Rectangle and initializes with size, x, y, id.
- Implement methods to calculate area, display the object, update attributes, and more for both Rectangle and Square classes.
- Implement a method to load JSON strings from files, save instances to a file, and create instances from a JSON file.
